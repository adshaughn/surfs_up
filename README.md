## Surf's Up, An Analysis of Weather in Hawai'i

# Overview

For the sake of potentially opening up a new chain of Surf Shops in Hawai'i, the client has requested an analysis of weather patterns on the islands.


# Results

There are three key takeaways from this analysis:

- The average temperature is remarkably similar between June and December, at 74.9F and 71.0F respectively.
- Overall temperatures show little variability, with there being a less than 2 degree difference between temperatures in the 50th and 75th percentiles.
- Precipitation is more variable, with much of Hawai'i's rainfall occurring in the winter months around December; June is comparatively dry.

# Summary

Overall, the analysis indicates that Hawaii would be an excellent location to open a chain of surf shops.
Temperatures are relatively constant with little seasonal variability, though precipitation is heavier in the winter.
However, there is more to weather than temperature and precipitation. 
As the client is hoping to open a chain of surf shops in Hawai'i, additional queries should be run to better understand wind speeds and tides, two important factors in determining the suitability of a location for surfing.
